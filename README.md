# Clientside SPARQL-parser
This webpage parses SPARQL-inputs in the browser.

### Background
This is the first little project in my Bachelor's project, 
supervised by Hannah Bast.
As a first step, I translated and modified the SPARQL-parser that 
I created for exercise sheet no. 12 of the Information Retrieval
lecture. Additionally, I added some syntax highlighting in the
output.
